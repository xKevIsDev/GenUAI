- [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/) for the code sandbox
- Next.js app router with Tailwind
- Shadcn, Aceternity, MagicUI for UI elements.
- Helicone for observability
- Plausible for website analytics

- [ ] Try chain of thought reasoning to see if it works better overall
- [ ] Try finetuning a smaller model on good prompts from 405b or GPT-4/Claude
- [ ] Add dark mode to the site overall, nice design change
- [ ] Surface errors better in codesandbox to the user so people know what is wrong
- [ ] Have 405B correct itself (sometimes it makes up imports)
- [ ] New route for updateCode that only sends the latest generated code + the modify request
- [ ] Fix bug where if a user edits the code, then does a change, it doesn't use the edited code
- [ ] Add rate limiting with redis upstash if the traffic gets too high
- [ ] Apply code diffs directly instead of asking the model to generate the code from scratch
- [ ] Add the ability to upload things like a screenshot for it to start from that
- [ ] Add a documentation route.
- [ ] Add bug/feedback reports.
